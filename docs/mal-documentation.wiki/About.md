IT systems are growing in complexity, and due to digitization and technological advancements, cyber attacks are increasing.  Parts of our world, such as cars,power grids and homes are now connected to the Internet.

In order to keep these systems secure, the first thing is to understand and map out different threatsand attacks on them.  Threat modeling is a process that can be used to analyze potential attacks or threats, in order to make sure the systems are designed bysecurity. 

This wiki is the description and hands-on manual of the Meta Attack Lan-guage (MAL), which is a threat modeling language framework for the creation of domain specific languages (DSL). In brief, MAL combines probabilistic attack defense graphs with object oriented modeling.  By using MAL it is possible to automate the security analysis of modeled systems. MAL is developed at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/nse/research/software-systems-architecture-and-security/projects/mal-the-meta-attack-language-1.922174). Several  domain  specific  languages  have  been  built  in  MAL  serving  as  examples  of  how  a  language  can  be  built. In addition to the research prototypes developed at KTH, the company [foreseeti]( https://www.foreseeti.com/) has developed a commercial product supporting language development and model simulations in MAL.
