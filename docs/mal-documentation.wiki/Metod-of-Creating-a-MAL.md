The method of how to construct a domain specific MAL begins with a clear understanding of the system that one wants to model. It is important to spend time learning about the system, because being comfortable in the domain will make modeling of the language much easier. The domain can often be studied through research paper and literature.  At other times it is useful to also consult experts and conduct interviews to ask any additional questions.  

After enough knowledge about the system is learnt, it is time to decide what the scope of the MAL should be. Modeling a system can easily become too complex if the scope is set too broad or too detailed. It is recommended to start with a smaller scope from the beginning and then broaden the scope as required with time.

Once the domain is well known and the scope is set, it is time to create the language. Begin by defining all the possible attack steps. After the attack steps are known, it is possible to define all the defences for these steps as well as their relationships.

It is important to thoroughly analyze each attack step in detail and find any potential defences as well as resulting new attack steps. A successful attack step may result in another attack step.  Also, there are situations where combined attack steps are required for a resulting attack step to be reached. All these relationships must be found and stated clearly. 

With the MAL specification completed, it is time to compile and validate the language.
