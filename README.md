## Description

Previously, MAL documentation was split into multiple wikis/git repos. This made
it hard for newcomers to study MAL. Places where MAL documentation was located:

- [MAL documentation wiki] on Github(https://github.com/mal-lang/mal-documentation/wiki)
- MAL documentation on the [MAL compiler's github repo](https://github.com/mal-lang/malcompiler/wiki)
- MAL related instructions in [exampleLang's README](https://github.com/mal-lang/exampleLang/)

The aim of this project is to gather all these sources, unify them, fix typos
and outdated content and expand the documentation in order to create a single
authoritative source for MAL.

## Work Products

- [ ] Complete Sphinx/RST documentation for MAL

## Resources
- [reStructuredText quick start](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html)
- [reStructuredText reference](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html)
- [Sphinx documentation](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/contents.html)
- [Read the Docs project][https://readthedocs.org/projects/mal-lang/]
